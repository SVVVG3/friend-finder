# Friend Finder Farcaster Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App that helps users manage and grow their network by:
1. Identifying one-way follows (asymmetric relationships)
2. Recommending warm connections based on mutual follows (2nd-degree connections)

Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, Neynar API, OnchainKit + Base MiniKit

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to handle Farcaster API rate limits efficiently
- Must implement proper caching to avoid repeated API calls
- UI should be optimized for mobile/mini-app experience
- Follow CRT theme design (green text, black background)

## High-level Task Breakdown

Following the 19 tasks outlined in tasks.md:

1. **Initialize Next.js App** - `npx create-next-app friend-finder --app --ts`
2. **Install dependencies** - Add required packages
3. **Add miniapp config files** - Configure metadata
4. **Set up Supabase + .env** - Database and environment setup
5. **Create Neynar API wrapper** - API client setup
6. **Add Farcaster helpers** - Domain-specific API wrappers
7. **Add profile cache utility** - Performance optimization
8. **Build sorting utilities** - Data processing
9. **Create recommendations API route** - Server-side logic
10. **Create WarmRecsList component** - UI for recommendations
11. **Wire up home page** - Main app interface
12. **Create OneWayList component** - UI for one-way follows
13. **Build one-way page** - Secondary app interface
14. **Create navigation component** - App navigation
15. **Set up layout** - App shell
16. **Create global styles** - CRT theme implementation
17. **Add loading states** - UX improvements
18. **Verify miniapp config** - Deployment preparation
19. **Deploy to Vercel** - Production deployment

Test page confirms all functionality works correctly.

Ready to commit changes and proceed to Task 11 (Wire up home page) once user confirms manual testing is successful.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
