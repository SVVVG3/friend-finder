# Friend Finder Farcaster Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App that helps users manage and grow their network by:
1. Identifying one-way follows (asymmetric relationships)
2. Recommending warm connections based on mutual follows (2nd-degree connections)

Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, Neynar API, OnchainKit + Base MiniKit

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to handle Farcaster API rate limits efficiently
- Must implement proper caching to avoid repeated API calls
- UI should be optimized for mobile/mini-app experience
- Follow CRT theme design (green text, black background)

## High-level Task Breakdown

Following the 19 tasks outlined in tasks.md:

1. **Initialize Next.js App** - `npx create-next-app friend-finder --app --ts`
2. **Install dependencies** - Add required packages
3. **Add miniapp config files** - Configure metadata
4. **Set up Supabase + .env** - Database and environment setup
5. **Create Neynar API wrapper** - API client setup
6. **Add Farcaster helpers** - Domain-specific API wrappers
7. **Add profile cache utility** - Performance optimization
8. **Build sorting utilities** - Data processing
9. **Create recommendations API route** - Server-side logic
10. **Create WarmRecsList component** - UI for recommendations
11. **Wire up home page** - Main app interface
12. **Create OneWayList component** - UI for one-way follows
13. **Build one-way page** - Secondary app interface
14. **Create navigation component** - App navigation
15. **Set up layout** - App shell
16. **Create global styles** - CRT theme implementation
17. **Add loading states** - UX improvements
18. **Verify miniapp config** - Deployment preparation
19. **Deploy to Vercel** - Production deployment

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**üéâ TASK 13 FINAL COMPLETION - ONE-WAY ANALYSIS PAGES:**

**Recent Critical Improvements:**
1. **API Performance Optimization**:
   - Increased batch size from 25 to 100 items per request
   - 4x more efficient API calls (reduces requests by 75%)
   - Successfully fetching complete datasets without rate limits
   - Example: 9,499 followers fetched across 95 pages in ~25 seconds

2. **Mobile UX Transformation - Page Splitting**:
   - **Problem**: Original combined page was too cluttered for mobile
   - **Solution**: Split into two focused, single-purpose pages:
     - `/one-way-out` - People you follow who don't follow back (orange theme)
     - `/one-way-in` - People who follow you but you don't follow back (blue theme)
   - **Benefits**: Cleaner mobile interface, focused messaging, better UX

3. **Beautiful Card Design Implementation**:
   - **Fixed**: Replaced broken styled-jsx with proper Tailwind CSS classes
   - **Result**: Beautiful cards matching main page design quality
   - **Features**: Hover effects, shadows, proper spacing, CRT theme consistency
   - **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions

4. **Smart Sorting by Influence**:
   - **Added**: Sort results by follower count (highest first)
   - **Benefit**: Most influential accounts appear at top of lists
   - **UI**: Clear indication that lists are sorted by influence
   - **Strategy**: Prioritize high-value connections for better networking

**üìä PRODUCTION READINESS STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ Complete data fetching (up to 20,000 followers/following per user)
- ‚úÖ Efficient API pagination with 100-item batches
- ‚úÖ Beautiful, mobile-optimized card design
- ‚úÖ Smart sorting by follower count
- ‚úÖ Focused single-purpose pages
- ‚úÖ Error handling and loading states
- ‚úÖ CRT theme consistency across all pages

**üéØ NEXT: Task 14 - Navigation Component**
Ready to create simple navigation between home page and one-way analysis pages.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Task 11 STATUS**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Core algorithm working with excellent quality results. Performance optimization needed but can be revisited later.

**Task 12 STATUS**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - OneWayList component created with two-column layout, CRT theme, follow/unfollow actions, mobile responsive design, and loading states.

**Task 13 STATUS**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - One-way analysis page created with asymmetric follow analysis, API endpoints (/api/followers, /api/following), CRT theme, stats grid, and loading states.

**üö® CRITICAL PAGINATION FIX - COMPLETE ANALYSIS:**
- **Problem**: 400 Bad Request errors even with 200 limit, incomplete analysis with limited data
- **User Insight**: "we should be showing all of their following/followers though... do we need to make multiple api calls in smaller amounts?"
- **Solution**: Implemented pagination with 25-item batches to fetch ALL data
- **Benefits**: 
  - Complete one-way analysis (up to 1000 followers/following each)
  - No more API rate limit errors with small batch sizes
  - Proper pagination with cursors and error handling
  - Progressive fetching with 100ms delays between pages

**Task 14 READY**: ‚≠ê **STARTING NEXT** - Create Nav component for simple navigation between home page and one-way page.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **Image Domain Issues**: Multiple domains require explicit configuration in next.config.ts:
  - warpcast.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - takocdn.xyz ‚úÖ Fixed  
  - ipfs.decentralized-content.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - tba-mobile.mypinata.cloud ‚úÖ Fixed
  - i.postimg.cc ‚úÖ Fixed
  - img.uno.fun ‚úÖ Fixed
  - **PERMANENT SOLUTION**: Added `unoptimized={true}` to all Image components to bypass domain restrictions entirely
  - This prevents ALL future image domain errors by skipping Next.js optimization
  - Trade-off: No image optimization, but eliminates recurring domain configuration issues
