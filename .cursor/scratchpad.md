# Friend Finder Farcaster Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App that helps users manage and grow their network by:
1. Identifying one-way follows (asymmetric relationships)
2. Recommending warm connections based on mutual follows (2nd-degree connections)

Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, Neynar API, OnchainKit + Base MiniKit

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to handle Farcaster API rate limits efficiently
- Must implement proper caching to avoid repeated API calls
- UI should be optimized for mobile/mini-app experience

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ALGORITHM FLAW DISCOVERED - USER INSIGHT**

**User's Question**: "Candidate Discovery: For each person you follow, we look at who follows THEM" - shouldn't we be looking at who THEY follow, not who follows them for better recommendations?

**ANALYSIS - USER IS 100% CORRECT:**

**Current (FLAWED) Algorithm:**
- User follows Alice ‚Üí Find who follows Alice ‚Üí Recommend Alice's followers
- Logic: "Find other fans of the same person you like"
- Problem: Biases toward popular accounts, misses quality connections

**Correct Algorithm Should Be:**
- User follows Alice ‚Üí Find who Alice follows ‚Üí Recommend Alice's following  
- Logic: "Find people that someone you trust also trusts"
- Benefits: Discovers people through trusted curators, better quality discovery

**Why This Makes More Sense:**
1. **Trust-based discovery**: If you follow someone, you trust their judgment about who to follow
2. **Interest alignment**: People you follow likely follow others with similar interests  
3. **Network expansion**: Discover new people through the lens of people whose taste you trust
4. **Quality over popularity**: Current approach biases toward popular people, alternative finds people with good taste regardless of follower count

**‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY!**

**Changed**: `getFollowers(followedUser.fid)` ‚Üí `getFollowing(followedUser.fid)`

**üéâ TRUST-BASED DISCOVERY RESULTS:**
- **mjc716**: **169 mutuals** (NEW RECORD!) üöÄ
- **gmonchain.eth**: **103 mutuals** 
- **revealcam**: **93 mutuals**
- **nickysap**: **85 mutuals**
- **jamai**: **83 mutuals**

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Trust-based algorithm finds even higher quality connections than previous follower-based approach! User's insight completely transformed recommendation quality.

**üîß COMPLETE NETWORK ANALYSIS FIX:**
- **Previous**: Deep analysis limited to 1200/2084 accounts (57% coverage)
- **Current**: Deep analysis now covers 1984/2084 accounts (95% coverage)
- **Improvement**: Analyzing complete filtered network for maximum accuracy
- **Filtering**: Only excludes bots (<100 followers), NOW INCLUDES mega-accounts
- **Result**: Finding even more high-quality connections through comprehensive analysis

**üéØ MEGA-ACCOUNT INCLUSION RESULTS:**
- **mjc716**: **172 mutuals** (up from 169) üöÄ
- **revealcam**: **106 mutuals** (up from 93, +13 improvement!)
- **gmonchain.eth**: **104 mutuals** (up from 103)
- **nickysap**: **99 mutuals** (up from 85, +14 improvement!)
- **jamai**: **87 mutuals** (up from 83)

**Why Mega-Accounts Provide Value**: Trust-based discovery leverages their curated following lists and expert judgment about who to follow.

**üö® CRITICAL BUG FIX: Exclusion Filter**
- **User Report**: "i'm also seeing people i already follow on the standard analysis - this shouldn't be happening?"
- **Root Cause**: Standard analysis only loaded first 750 following accounts for exclusion filter, but user follows 2000+
- **Problem**: Anyone user follows beyond #750 could appear as recommendations (serious bug!)
- **Fix**: Always load complete following list (up to 2500) for exclusion filter, regardless of analysis mode
- **Result**: Proper exclusion of all followed accounts, analysis selection separate from exclusion filter

**üõ°Ô∏è BUSINESS ACCOUNT FILTER:**
- **User Insight**: Exclude accounts following <100 people (typically business/project accounts, not real people)
- **Implementation**: Added `filter(user => (user.followingCount || 0) >= 100)` to recommendation candidates
- **Benefit**: Only recommend active social accounts that meaningfully engage with the platform

**üö® CRITICAL PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATIONS:**
- **Problem**: 60,000+ API calls per search, 6+ minute response times (unacceptable for production)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Analyzing too many accounts (1,984) with too many API calls per account (~30 each)

**IMMEDIATE FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **Drastically Reduced Analysis Scope**:
   - Standard: 75 accounts (was 300) = ~1,875 API calls vs 9,000
   - Deep: 200 accounts (was unlimited 1,984) = ~5,000 API calls vs 60,000
   - **75-90% reduction in API usage**

2. **Optimized Following Limits**:
   - Reduced from 30-40 per account to 20-25 per account
   - **33% fewer API calls per analyzed account**

3. **Improved Rate Limiting**:
   - Reduced batch size: 20 accounts (was 25)
   - Increased inter-batch delays: 500ms (was 200ms)
   - Smart rate limiting: 100ms delay every 10 requests
   - **Exponential backoff on 429 errors: 2 second delays**

4. **Better Progress Reporting**:
   - Report progress every 25 accounts instead of 100
   - Clear estimated completion times in UI
   - **User expectations properly set**

**EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS**:
- **Standard Analysis**: ~30-45 seconds (was 1+ minute)
- **Deep Analysis**: ~1-2 minutes (was 6+ minutes)
- **API Usage**: 75-90% reduction in total API calls
- **Rate Limit Hits**: Dramatically reduced through better pacing

**üö® CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUE - USER FEEDBACK:**
- **User Report**: "but now I feel like the data is not as complete, reliable or useful.."
- **Problem**: Over-aggressive optimization sacrificed data quality
- **Evidence**: Went from 100+ high-quality recommendations to only 3 total recommendations
- **Analysis**: Still hitting rate limits despite "optimizations", poor user experience

**REBALANCED APPROACH - DATA QUALITY FOCUS:**
1. **Increased Analysis Scope for Quality**:
   - Standard: 150 accounts (up from 75, balanced from original 300)
   - Deep: 500 accounts (up from 200, balanced from unlimited 1,984)
   - **Focus on useful results while managing API usage**

2. **Restored Following Limits**:
   - Base: 25 per account (up from 20, down from 30)
   - Large accounts: 30 per account (up from 25, down from 40)
   - **Better data coverage without excessive API calls**

3. **SMART RATE LIMITING with Exponential Backoff**:
   - Progressive delays: 300ms every 5 requests
   - Checkpoint delays: 1.5s every 25 requests  
   - Exponential backoff on 429s: 5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 30s max
   - **Much better rate limit management**

4. **Intelligent Error Handling**:
   - Track consecutive errors, stop after 10 failures
   - Different delays for rate limits vs other errors
   - **Robust handling of API issues**

**BALANCED PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS**:
- **Standard Analysis**: ~30-60 seconds (150 accounts with smart rate limiting)
- **Deep Analysis**: ~2-3 minutes (500 accounts with smart rate limiting) 
- **Data Quality**: Restored to useful levels with 15+ recommendations
- **Rate Limit Management**: Exponential backoff prevents cascading failures

**KEY INSIGHT**: The user was right - we overcorrected and sacrificed the core value proposition. Better to have a slower but useful app than a fast but useless one.

**üéØ CRITICAL ACCOUNT SELECTION BREAKTHROUGH - USER INSIGHT:**
- **User's Key Insight**: "maybe the problem is in which accounts we are analyze. we should be pulling all following for the user and analyzing all of them that have more than 1000 followers"
- **Problem**: We were using arbitrary caps (500 accounts) instead of focusing on account quality
- **Solution**: Analyze ALL accounts with meaningful follower counts

**NEW SMART ACCOUNT SELECTION:**
1. **Standard Analysis**: 
   - Filter: Accounts with 500+ followers
   - Cap: 150 accounts (for speed)
   - Target: Quick results for moderately active accounts

2. **Deep Analysis**: 
   - Filter: Accounts with 1000+ followers  
   - Cap: NONE - analyze ALL qualifying accounts
   - Target: Comprehensive analysis of high-quality accounts

**WHY THIS APPROACH IS BETTER:**
- **Quality Focus**: 1000+ followers indicates real, active social accounts
- **Complete Coverage**: No arbitrary caps means we don't miss high-quality connections
- **Targeted**: Instead of analyzing random accounts, focus on those likely to have good networks
- **Scalable**: Automatically adjusts to user's network composition

**EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:**
- **Data Quality**: Much higher quality recommendations from accounts with real followings
- **Completeness**: Won't miss connections due to arbitrary account limits
- **Efficiency**: Focus API calls on accounts most likely to yield good results
- **User-Specific**: Results scale with the quality of accounts the user follows

**üö® PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TODO (REVISIT LATER):**

**Current Results (EXCELLENT QUALITY):**
- mjc716: 164 mutuals üöÄ
- gmonchain.eth: 103 mutuals  
- nickysap: 87 mutuals
- yashhsm: 75 mutuals
- 103 accounts with 15+ mutuals, 25 with 30+ mutuals, 6 with 50+ mutuals!

**Current Problems (PERFORMANCE):**
- Deep analysis: 431 seconds (7+ minutes) - UNACCEPTABLE for production
- Still hitting rate limits despite smart rate limiting
- Processing 1,529 accounts with 1000+ followers = too many API calls
- Need to find balance between quality and speed

**Future Optimization Ideas:**
1. **Smarter Sampling**: Instead of ALL 1000+ accounts, sample strategically
2. **Incremental Loading**: Show results as they come in, not all at once  
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache following lists for popular accounts
4. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple accounts simultaneously 
5. **Progressive Analysis**: Start with highest follower accounts first
6. **User Choice**: Let users choose speed vs completeness
7. **Background Processing**: Queue analysis, notify when complete

**Target Performance Goals:**
- Standard: <30 seconds
- Deep: <2 minutes  
- No rate limit hits
- Maintain current quality level

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **Image Domain Issues**: Multiple domains require explicit configuration in next.config.ts:
  - warpcast.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - takocdn.xyz ‚úÖ Fixed  
  - ipfs.decentralized-content.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - tba-mobile.mypinata.cloud ‚úÖ Fixed
  - i.postimg.cc ‚úÖ Fixed
  - img.uno.fun ‚úÖ Fixed
  - **PERMANENT SOLUTION**: Added `unoptimized={true}` to all Image components to bypass domain restrictions entirely
  - This prevents ALL future image domain errors by skipping Next.js optimization
  - Trade-off: No image optimization, but eliminates recurring domain configuration issues
