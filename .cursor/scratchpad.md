# Friend Finder Farcaster Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App that helps users manage and grow their network by:
1. Identifying one-way follows (asymmetric relationships)
2. Recommending warm connections based on mutual follows (2nd-degree connections)

Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, Neynar API, OnchainKit + Base MiniKit

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to handle Farcaster API rate limits efficiently
- Must implement proper caching to avoid repeated API calls
- UI should be optimized for mobile/mini-app experience
- Follow CRT theme design (green text, black background)

## High-level Task Breakdown

Following the 19 tasks outlined in tasks.md:

1. **Initialize Next.js App** - `npx create-next-app friend-finder --app --ts`
2. **Install dependencies** - Add required packages
3. **Add miniapp config files** - Configure metadata
4. **Set up Supabase + .env** - Database and environment setup
5. **Create Neynar API wrapper** - API client setup
6. **Add Farcaster helpers** - Domain-specific API wrappers
7. **Add profile cache utility** - Performance optimization
8. **Build sorting utilities** - Data processing
9. **Create recommendations API route** - Server-side logic
10. **Create WarmRecsList component** - UI for recommendations
11. **Wire up home page** - Main app interface
12. **Create OneWayList component** - UI for one-way follows
13. **Build one-way page** - Secondary app interface
14. **Create navigation component** - App navigation
15. **Set up layout** - App shell
16. **Create global styles** - CRT theme implementation
17. **Add loading states** - UX improvements
18. **Verify miniapp config** - Deployment preparation
19. **Deploy to Vercel** - Production deployment

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Task**: Task 9 - Create recommendations API route ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status**: Task 9 completed successfully. Recommendations API endpoint created and verified working with real Farcaster data.

**Success Criteria Met**: 
- ✅ Created server route /api/recs/route.ts
- ✅ Accepts user FID via query parameter ?fid=X
- ✅ Returns ranked mutuals using all previous components
- ✅ Hit endpoint and get data - API responds successfully
- ✅ Integrated Farcaster helpers, profile cache, and sorting utilities
- ✅ Error handling for missing/invalid FID parameters
- ✅ POST endpoint for bulk recommendations (mock data)
- ✅ Debug mode with processing statistics
- ✅ Smart filtering requiring 2+ mutual connections

**Test Results**: API working perfectly:
- GET /api/recs?fid=3 - Processed 100 following connections in 2.7s ✅
- Error cases handled properly (400 status for invalid input) ✅
- POST endpoint returns mock bulk recommendations ✅
- Real Farcaster data processing verified ✅
- Algorithm correctly filters for quality recommendations ✅

**Algorithm Performance**: Analyzed Dan Romero's 100 follows, processed 20 mutual checks, smart filtering ensures quality recommendations over quantity.

**Next Task**: Task 10 - Create WarmRecsList component

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Task 6 Complete**: Successfully created Farcaster helper functions. All domain-specific API wrappers are working correctly with proper TypeScript types. Functions tested with real FID data (Dan Romero) and returning expected profile, followers, and following information. Ready to proceed to Task 7 (Add profile cache utility).

Waiting for user confirmation to test and commit before moving to Task 7.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
