# Friend Finder Farcaster Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App that helps users manage and grow their network by:
1. Identifying one-way follows (asymmetric relationships)
2. Recommending warm connections based on mutual follows (2nd-degree connections)

Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, Neynar API, OnchainKit + Base MiniKit

**üö® NEW PRIORITY: Mobile Optimization**
User feedback indicates the app needs significant mobile UX improvements. Analysis shows several mobile optimization gaps that need immediate attention.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to handle Farcaster API rate limits efficiently
- Must implement proper caching to avoid repeated API calls
- UI should be optimized for mobile/mini-app experience
- Follow CRT theme design (green text, black background)
- **CRITICAL**: Mobile optimization gaps identified requiring immediate attention

### Mobile Optimization Analysis

**Current Issues Identified:**

1. **Viewport Configuration**: Basic viewport meta tag present but needs mobile-first optimizations
2. **Navigation Layout**: 3-button horizontal layout may be cramped on small screens
3. **Card Design**: Cards use fixed padding/margins that may not adapt well to mobile
4. **Form Inputs**: FID input forms may be difficult to use on mobile keyboards
5. **Text Sizing**: Font sizes may not scale properly for different screen sizes
6. **Touch Targets**: Button sizes may be too small for finger taps
7. **Content Spacing**: Vertical spacing and layouts may not be optimized for mobile scrolling
8. **Loading States**: Loading indicators may not be prominent enough on mobile
9. **Error Handling**: Error messages may not be readable on small screens

**Mobile-First Requirements:**
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px)
- Responsive typography with fluid scaling
- Optimized vertical layouts
- Improved form UX with mobile keyboards
- Bottom sheet navigation consideration
- Swipe gestures support
- Optimized loading states
- Mobile-first grid systems

**üé® Design Principles for Mobile Optimization:**

**PRESERVE CRT AESTHETIC:**
- ‚úÖ Keep green text (#10b981, #16a34a, #22c55e) on black (#000000) backgrounds
- ‚úÖ Maintain terminal/monospace font families (font-mono)
- ‚úÖ Preserve dotted/solid green borders and CRT-style effects
- ‚úÖ Keep hover effects with green glows and shadows
- ‚úÖ Maintain emoji icons and terminal-style messaging
- ‚úÖ Preserve color-coded themes: green (warm recs), blue (follow in), orange (follow out)

**MOBILE OPTIMIZATIONS:**
- üì± Responsive breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- üëÜ Touch targets minimum 44px height with adequate spacing
- üìù Larger, more accessible form inputs with mobile keyboards
- üîÑ Simplified navigation that works on small screens
- üìè Fluid typography that scales appropriately
- üéØ Improved loading states with larger indicators
- üì± Mobile-first grid layouts with proper spacing
- üîò Enhanced button designs for touch interaction

**IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:**
1. Preserve existing CRT theme colors and effects
2. Add responsive utilities and mobile-specific improvements
3. Enhance touch interactions while keeping visual consistency
4. Optimize layouts for mobile without losing terminal aesthetic
5. Improve accessibility while maintaining green/black color scheme

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **Image Domain Issues**: Multiple domains require explicit configuration in next.config.ts:
  - warpcast.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - takocdn.xyz ‚úÖ Fixed  
  - ipfs.decentralized-content.com ‚úÖ Fixed
  - tba-mobile.mypinata.cloud ‚úÖ Fixed
  - i.postimg.cc ‚úÖ Fixed
  - img.uno.fun ‚úÖ Fixed
  - **PERMANENT SOLUTION**: Added `unoptimized={true}` to all Image components to bypass domain restrictions entirely
  - This prevents ALL future image domain errors by skipping Next.js optimization
  - Trade-off: No image optimization, but eliminates recurring domain configuration issues
